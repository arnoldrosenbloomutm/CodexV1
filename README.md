# CodexV1

Collection of short probability demonstrations in Python. Each example shows the distribution of outcomes for a simple random process.

## Quick start

### Requirements
- Python 3 (3.8 or newer recommended)

Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run any example script from the `examples/` directory:

```bash
python3 examples/<script_name>.py
```

For instance, to run the coin-flip demonstration:

```bash
python3 examples/coin_flip.py
```

The coin-flip script simulates 100 flips in 1,000 trials, prints the resulting counts and displays a histogram of heads.

## Examples directory

All example scripts live in the `examples/` directory. These short programs are intended as educational references.
