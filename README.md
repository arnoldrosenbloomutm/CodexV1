# CodexV1

This repository contains small Python code examples that demonstrate the distribution of outcomes for various probability experiments. Each example demonstrates a probability distribution.

## Running the coin-flip example

### Requirements
- Python 3 (3.8 or newer recommended)

All Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Install them with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the coin-flip script:

```bash
python3 examples/coin_flip.py
```

The script will simulate 100 flips in 1,000 trials, print the resulting counts and display a histogram of heads.

## Examples directory

All example scripts live in the `examples/` directory. These short programs are intended as educational references, so contributions of new examples or improvements are welcome. Feel free to open a pull request!
