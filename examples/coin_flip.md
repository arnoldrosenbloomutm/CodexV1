# Coin Flip Example

This script simulates flipping a fair coin 100 times for 1,000 trials.
It prints how often each number of heads occurs and then displays a histogram
of the distribution.

## Requirements

The script relies on the `matplotlib` package in addition to Python's standard
library. See the [repository README](../README.md) for instructions on installing
packages from `requirements.txt`.

## Usage

Run the example from the project root with:

```bash
python3 coin_flip.py
```

You should see a list of counts for each possible number of heads followed by a
histogram window showing the distribution.
